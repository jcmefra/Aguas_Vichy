# Aguas de Vichy: ERT Modelling and Inversion

This repository contains code and data for an ERT (Electrical Resistivity Tomography) modelling and inversion project. The goal is to create a subsurface image that shows the aquifer and the hot water infiltration into that aquifer at Aguas de Vichy, a hot spring located in San Andr√©s, Santander, Colombia.

## Introduction

In this section, I will provide some background information about the hot spring, the geology of the area, the motivation and objectives of the project, and the main research questions.

## Data Collection and Processing

In this section, I will describe how I collected and processed the ERT data. I will mention the equipment, the survey design, the data quality control, and the software tools that I used.

## Modelling and Inversion

In this section, I will explain how I performed the ERT modelling and inversion. I will mention the forward and inverse models, the parameters, the optimization methods, and the error analysis that I used.

## Results and Discussion

In this section, I will present and discuss the results of my ERT modelling and inversion. I will use figures, tables, and graphs to illustrate my findings. I will also compare my results with previous studies or other methods.

## Conclusion and Future Work

In this section, I will summarize my main findings, conclusions, and contributions of the project. I will also suggest some limitations, challenges, and directions for future work.

## References

In this section, I will list the references that I cited in my README.md file. I will use any citation style that I prefer.
