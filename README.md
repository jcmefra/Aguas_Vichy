# Aguas Vichy: ERT Modelling and Inversion
## IMPORTANT: This README.md file is a template, it'll be filled along with the project development

This repository contains code and data for an ERT (Electrical Resistivity Tomography) modelling and inversion project. The goal is to create a subsurface image that shows the aquifer and the hot water infiltration into that aquifer at Aguas Vichy, a hot spring located in San AndrÃ©s, Santander, Colombia.

## Introduction

In this section, you can provide some background information about the hot spring, the geology of the area, the motivation and objectives of the project, and the main research questions.

## Data Collection and Processing

In this section, you can describe how you collected and processed the ERT data. You can mention the equipment, the survey design, the data quality control, and the software tools that you used.

## Modelling and Inversion

In this section, you can explain how you performed the ERT modelling and inversion. You can mention the forward and inverse models, the parameters, the optimization methods, and the error analysis that you used.

## Results and Discussion

In this section, you can present and discuss the results of your ERT modelling and inversion. You can use figures, tables, and graphs to illustrate your findings. You can also compare your results with previous studies or other methods.

## Conclusion and Future Work

In this section, you can summarize your main findings, conclusions, and contributions of the project. You can also suggest some limitations, challenges, and directions for future work.

## References

In this section, you can list the references that you cited in your README.md file. You can use any citation style that you prefer.

I hope this template helps you with your project. If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know. ðŸ˜Š
